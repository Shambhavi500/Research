# 1. Executive Summary & The Core Thesis

### The One-Line Pitch
> **"A kirana doesn't need another manual billing app. It needs an iQOO 15 that photographs physical deliveries, matches them against vendor bills, stops expired sales with haptic alerts, physically controls shop cooling via the IR blaster, and answers inventory questions in spoken Hindi—100% offline."**

India is powered by over **12 million neighbourhood kirana stores**, driving 85%+ of the country’s retail FMCG commerce. While supermarkets run enterprise ERPs with barcode conveyor belts, the independent Indian kirana owner operates in high-frequency chaos.

Existing SaaS billing and inventory apps fail because they only record what the shopkeeper *types*. In the middle of rush-hour trading, shopkeepers do not have time to type.

**Kirana Rakshak fundamentally changes the paradigm: We verify what physically arrives and what physically leaves.** 

By transforming the **iQOO 15** into an autonomous, offline edge-AI auditor and physical store guardian, Kirana Rakshak:
* **Audits Wholesale Deliveries in <300ms:** Matches physical packet counts against vendor challans via 50MP Ultrawide computer vision + on-device OCR.
* **Calibrates Against 50Hz Glare:** Uses the **Color Spectrum Sensor** to defeat tube-light flicker and specular reflections on foil packaging.
* **Stops Expired Sales via Haptics:** Reads inkjet dot-matrix expiry dates via the **50MP 3x Telemacro**, intercepting sales with an aggressive **X-Axis linear haptic buzz**.
* **Physically Controls Store Appliances:** Uses the hardware **IR Blaster** to lock deep-freezers into super-freeze mode when perishable dairy arrives.
* **Geographically Locks Invoices:** Uses native **NavIC L5 GNSS** to generate tamper-proof Proof-of-Delivery (PoD) stamps in dense bazaar lanes.
* **Speaks in Hands-Free Hindi:** Translates natural Hindi queries into deterministic SQLite facts, broadcast loudly across the shop using the **dual stereo speakers as a built-in Soundbox**.

All processing runs in **100% Airplane Mode** on the **Snapdragon 8 Elite Hexagon NPU**, bridging to workstations during the Green Light phase via **iQOO Office Kit**.

```

1. **Short Deliveries (₹8,000–₹15,000 / month loss):** Distributors deliver 30–50 crates daily during morning rush hours. A bill says 24 packets of Maggi; the delivery boy unloads 20. The shopkeeper discovers the ₹56 shortage days later—or never. Across 15 vendors, this is an immense cash bleed.
2. **Expired Stock Write-Offs (₹5,000–₹10,000 / month loss):** FMCG distributors allow retailers to return unsold goods for 100% credit *if returned 30 days before expiry*. But old stock gets buried under new crates. By the time it is found, it is dead-loss inventory.
3. **Cold-Chain Spoilage (₹3,000–₹6,000 / month loss):** High-margin dairy (Amul milk, paneer, ice-cream tubs) curdles or melts when counter freezers are turned down or power cuts strike.
4. **Customer Churn from Expired Sales:** Accidental sales of expired goods lead to severe customer embarrassment, lost goodwill, and food safety liabilities.
5. **The English & Typing Barrier:** Existing billing software requires continuous typing, barcode scanning for every SKU, and fast internet—completely unusable for a sole proprietor serving 3 customers simultaneously.

# 3. The Solution: Kirana Rakshak System Overview

Kirana Rakshak runs on an iQOO 15 mounted on a counter stand. It executes three fundamental jobs:
1. **Verify Every Important Delivery:** Photo of goods + photo of invoice $\rightarrow$ physical count vs. billed count $\rightarrow$ instant shortage flag in rupees.
2. **Protect Against Expiry & Spoilage:** Macro scan of printed expiry $\rightarrow$ automated distributor return alert $\rightarrow$ violent haptic vibration blocking expired sales $\rightarrow$ IR blaster locking freezer cooling.
3. **Talk to the Shopkeeper in Spoken Hindi:** Voice query in Hindi $\rightarrow$ on-device intent understanding $\rightarrow$ deterministic local SQLite query $\rightarrow$ spoken answer via high-SPL stereo speakers.

```

### Scene 1: 9:00 AM — Morning Delivery Audit
* **Action:** Distributor Rajesh rushes in with cartons and a handwritten bill: *"24 Maggi 2-Min (70g) @ ₹14 = ₹336"*.
* **1-Tap NFC:** Rajesh taps his delivery ID card on the iQOO 15. The phone vibrates and opens his account.
* **NavIC L5:** The phone captures sub-meter coordinates, creating an unalterable Proof-of-Delivery tag.
* **Color Spectrum Calibrated Photo:** Ramesh snaps the counter with the 50MP Ultrawide lens (119° FOV). The Color Spectrum Sensor kills 50Hz tube-light flicker.
* **The Catch (<300ms):** YOLO11n counts 20 packets. PaddleOCR reads 24 on the bill. The phone double-knocks with haptic feedback:
  > **⚠️ SHORT DELIVERY: Billed 24 | Counted 20 | Short 4 | Vendor owes ₹56.00**
* **Result:** Ramesh immediately deducts ₹56 from the payment. Cash saved on the spot.

### Scene 2: 11:30 AM — Stocking Dairy & IR Actuation
* **Telemacro Scan:** Ramesh holds an ice-cream tub 25cm away. The 50MP 3x Telemacro reads the faint inkjet date (`EXP: 15-OCT-2026`).
* **Physical IR Pulse:** The app detects perishable dairy intake. The top-frame **IR Blaster** fires an NEC 38kHz infrared command across the shop, switching the counter deep-freezer to **Super-Freeze mode**.

### Scene 3: 4:00 PM — Expired Sale Blocked
* A customer brings salt, detergent, and an expired packet of Parle-G from the back shelf.
* As the cashier adds the batch, Kirana Rakshak checks the SQLite batch registry.
* **The Block:** The phone emits an **aggressive 500ms haptic buzz** and turns the screen **RED: SALE BLOCKED**. Ramesh replaces the expired packet with fresh stock, protecting customer trust.

### Scene 4: 7:30 PM — Hands-Free Hindi Soundbox
* With flour and spices on his hands, Ramesh asks from across the counter:
  > *"Rajesh vendor ne kitna kam maal diya hai aur is hafte kya expire hoga?"*
* Whisper STT + Laya 322M parse the intent locally.
* The **dual high-SPL stereo speakers** announce loudly across the 80dB noisy store:
  > *"Rajesh vendor se 4 packet Maggi kam aaye the, kul chhappan rupaye lene baaki hain. Aur 30 September ko 12 Bourbon expire hone wale hain."*

### Scene 5: 9:30 PM — Office Kit Closing Sync
* Ramesh opens his laptop. Kirana Rakshak connects via **iQOO Office Kit**.
* The phone displays a live merchant audit scorecard, and a complete reconciled day-end `.xlsx` file is transferred to the laptop with one click for GST filing.

# 13. The Winning 2-Minute Live Demo Script (Airplane Mode)

* **[0:00 – 0:15] Reality Check & Airplane Mode Proof:**
  Presenter puts the iQOO 15 into **Airplane Mode (Wi-Fi OFF, Cellular OFF)**. Introduces Ramesh's daily reality: *"Distributor arrives with 20 items, charges for 24, and leaves. Ramesh loses ₹56 in 10 seconds."*
* **[0:15 – 0:40] Catch 1: NFC Tap & Short Delivery Live Audit:**
  Presenter taps a mock distributor NFC card. The phone loads *"Rajesh - Nestle"*. Snaps the table with the **50MP Ultrawide Camera** (calibrated via Color Spectrum Sensor). Snaps the bill. Within 300ms:
  **"⚠️ SHORT DELIVERY DETECTED: Bill says 24 Maggi. Counted 20. Short: 4. Vendor owes ₹56."**  
  *Stamps NavIC L5 sub-meter coordinates.*
* **[0:40 – 1:00] Catch 2: Cold-Chain Physical Actuation (IR Blaster):**
  Presenter logs dairy/ice-cream intake. The phone triggers its **Top-Frame IR Blaster** to pulse a signal to a benchtop IR receiver, lighting up an LED on the judging table.
* **[1:00 – 1:25] Catch 3: Expired Sale Interception (Haptics):**
  A customer attempts to buy 3 items. Cashier scans them. One packet has an expired batch date.
  The iQOO 15 **buzzes with an aggressive haptic rumble**, flashes **RED: SALE BLOCKED**, and refuses to add the expired item to the bill.
* **[1:25 – 1:45] Catch 4: Hindi Voice & Built-in Soundbox:**
  Presenter presses mic: *"Rajesh vendor ne kitna kam maal diya?"*
  Dual stereo speakers broadcast in loud Hindi: *"Rajesh vendor se 4 packet Maggi kam aaye the, kul chhappan rupaye lene baaki hain."*
* **[1:45 – 2:00] Catch 5: Office Kit Green Light Sync:**
  Presenter connects the phone to the laptop via iQOO Office Kit. The laptop displays the customer-facing bill and downloads the reconciled Excel audit report.

# 16. Official Phase 1 Portal Submission Copy (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Field 1: Project Title
**Kirana Rakshak: The Offline AI Loss-Prevention & Cold-Chain System for Indian Retail Powered by iQOO 15**

### Field 2: Track Selection
* **Primary Track:** **Productivity**
* **Secondary Track / Technical Anchor:** **Open Innovation**

### Field 3: One-Line Elevator Pitch
> **"A kirana doesn't need another manual billing app. It needs an iQOO 15 that photographs physical deliveries, matches them against vendor bills, stops expired sales with haptic alerts, physically controls shop cooling via the IR blaster, and answers inventory questions in spoken Hindi—100% offline."**

### Field 4: Problem Statement & Economic Gravity
India is home to over 12 million neighbourhood kirana stores, powering 85%+ of the country’s retail FMCG distribution. While supermarket chains use million-dollar ERPs and barcode conveyors, the independent Indian kirana owner operates in high-frequency chaos:
1. **Short Delivery Leakage:** Wholesale distributors deliver 30–50 crates daily during morning rush hours. Shopkeepers cannot manually count every biscuit packet while attending to counter customers. A bill stating 24 units often delivers only 20, leaking ₹8,000–₹15,000 every month in unverified deliveries.
2. **Expired Stock Write-offs & Spoilage:** Perishable goods get pushed to the dark back of shelves, missing the 30-day distributor return window and causing ₹5,000–₹10,000/month in dead loss. Unmonitored deep-freezers lead to melted ice-cream and curdled dairy during power cuts.
3. **Consumer Trust & Expired Sales:** Accidental sales of expired goods lead to severe customer friction and loss of neighborhood reputation.
4. **Cognitive & Language Barrier:** Existing SaaS billing apps demand manual typing, English literacy, continuous internet, and barcode scanning for every individual SKU—unusable for a sole proprietor handling 20 customers simultaneously.

### Field 5: Proposed Solution
Kirana Rakshak transforms the shopkeeper’s iQOO 15 into an autonomous, offline computer-vision auditor and physical store guardian:
1. **Physical Delivery Verification:** Vendor checks in with 1-tap NFC. NavIC L5 captures sub-meter coordinates for tamper-proof Proof-of-Delivery. Color Spectrum Sensor eliminates 50Hz tube-light glare. The 50MP Ultrawide camera snaps the goods, and YOLO11n INT8 counts packets in ~22ms while PaddleOCR parses the invoice, instantly flagging shortages in rupees.
2. **Physical Store Actuation:** The top-frame IR Blaster autonomously pulses the shop deep-freezer into super-freeze mode when perishable dairy is received.
3. **Automated Expiry Watch:** The 50MP 3x Telemacro scans printed dot-matrix expiry dates. Expired items scanned at checkout trigger an aggressive X-axis linear haptic rumble and block the sale.
4. **Conversational Hindi Voice:** On-device Whisper STT + Laya 322M extract intent; deterministic SQL queries SQLite; and dual stereo speakers announce answers loudly across the shop like a built-in Soundbox.

### Field 6: iQOO 15 Hardware Synergy
* **Snapdragon 8 Elite NPU:** Runs YOLO11n, OCR, Whisper, and Laya in <250ms in 100% Airplane Mode.
* **Supercomputing Chip Q3:** Drives the 144Hz AR HUD without CPU/NPU contention.
* **Color Spectrum Sensor + ALS:** Eliminates 50Hz tube-light flicker and glare on glossy foil.
* **Top-Frame IR Blaster:** Physical appliance control for freezers and alarm strobes.
* **Triple 50MP Cameras:** Ultrawide for counter sweeps; 3x Telemacro for dot-matrix dates.
* **NavIC L5 Dual-Band GNSS:** Sub-meter Indian satellite Proof-of-Delivery.
* **X-Axis Linear Haptics:** Distinct tactile alerts in loud 80dB shops.
* **Omnidirectional NFC:** 1-Tap distributor crate check-in.
* **Dual High-SPL Speakers:** Built-in Kirana Soundbox saving ₹125/month rent.
* **7000 mAh Battery + VC:** 12-hour continuous counter operation at <37°C.
* **3D Ultrasonic Fingerprint:** Biometric auth through dusty, oily merchant hands.

### Field 7: iQOO Office Kit Cross-Device Architecture
* **Red Light Phase (Phone-First):** Full audit, counting, OCR, SQLite persistence, and Hindi voice run standalone in Airplane Mode.
* **Green Light Phase (Laptop + Phone):** Dual display projection renders a private Cashier HUD on the phone and a clean customer receipt on the laptop, plus 1-click day-end Excel (`.xlsx`) export.
