# iQOO 15 --- Hackathon Hardware & AI Capability Dossier

**Purpose:** A practical technical reference for designing an iQOO
Hackathon 2026 project around the actual capabilities of the iQOO 15.

**Scope:** Hardware, sensors, cameras, compute, AI, connectivity,
battery, thermal system, display, I/O, software capabilities, hackathon
use cases, and the highest-value capabilities to exploit.

> **Important:** This document distinguishes between (1) specifications
> publicly documented by iQOO, Qualcomm, or iQOO Community documentation
> and (2) engineering opportunities inferred from those capabilities. It
> does **not** invent undisclosed PCB-level component numbers, sensor
> part numbers, kernel support, or NPU access APIs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Executive Summary

The iQOO Hackathon 2026 is explicitly a **phone-first** competition
built around the **iQOO 15**. The official hackathon announcement says
participants use the iQOO 15 during the Red Light phase, can combine
phone and laptop workflows during the Green Light phase, and are
evaluated on phone-first execution, AI integration, Office Kit usage,
real-world relevance, and final pitch quality.

The iQOO 15 is therefore best treated as a **portable multimodal
computing and sensing platform**, not merely as an Android screen.

### The most important capabilities for a hackathon

1.  **Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5** --- flagship CPU/GPU/NPU platform for
    demanding local computation.
2.  **Supercomputing Chip Q3** --- dedicated graphics/AI-oriented
    companion chip with rendering and ray-tracing capabilities.
3.  **Triple 50 MP rear cameras** --- main + ultrawide + 3x periscope,
    enabling visual AI across different distances and fields of view.
4.  **Microphone/audio input** --- enables acoustic intelligence and
    multimodal audio + vision systems.
5.  **Accelerometer + gyroscope** --- physical movement, vibration and
    orientation sensing.
6.  **E-compass** --- heading/direction context.
7.  **GNSS including NavIC** --- location and geospatial context.
8.  **Color-spectrum sensor + triple ambient-light sensors** ---
    environmental/light sensing.
9.  **NFC + IR blaster** --- interaction with physical objects and
    appliances.
10. **USB-C 3.2 Gen 1 + Bluetooth 6.0** --- possible bridge to external
    peripherals/sensor hardware, subject to hackathon rules and Android
    access.
11. **7000 mAh battery + 100 W wired + 40 W wireless charging** ---
    supports long field demonstrations and sustained use.
12. **Large vapor-chamber cooling system** --- important for sustained
    AI/computer-vision workloads.
13. **IP68/IP69 protection** --- useful for controlled
    outdoor/field-oriented concepts, while avoiding exposure beyond the
    device's rated conditions.
14. **OriginOS 6 based on Android 16** --- modern Android software
    environment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. Hackathon Context

The official iQOO Hackathon 2026 announcement describes the event as
India's phone-first hackathon series and specifically states that the
challenge uses the iQOO 15.

### Red Light

Build primarily using the iQOO smartphone.

### Green Light

Combine smartphone and laptop workflows.

### Official evaluation themes

The official announcement identifies:

-   Phone-first execution
-   AI integration
-   Office Kit usage
-   Real-world relevance
-   Final pitch quality

### Design implication

A strong project should answer:

> **Why does this solution need the iQOO 15?**

A weak implementation merely runs an ordinary app on the phone.

A stronger implementation makes the iQOO 15 itself part of the sensing,
inference, computation, interaction, or field-deployment architecture.

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 21. IR Blaster

The iQOO 15 includes an IR blaster.

It can control compatible appliances such as:

-   TVs
-   ACs
-   Set-top boxes
-   Other IR-controlled devices

### Hackathon potential

This is an unusual physical-world output channel.

Instead of:

``` text
AI → recommendation
```

you can create:

``` text
AI
 ↓
Decision
 ↓
IR command
 ↓
Physical appliance changes state
```

### Example

An AI smart-room system could:

-   detect room state
-   infer user intent
-   control AC

### Architecture

``` text
External Sensor
      ↓
USB-C / OTG
      ↓
iQOO 15
      ↓
Local AI
      ↓
Decision
```

### Critical rule

Whether external hardware is permitted during a specific hackathon phase
must be confirmed with the organizers. The official format emphasizes
phone-first execution, so external hardware should be treated as
optional until the event rules explicitly allow it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 23. Bluetooth 6.0

Bluetooth 6.0 provides a wireless interface for compatible peripherals.

### Potential hackathon uses

-   BLE sensors
-   ESP32 sensor nodes

-   Beacon-based systems

### Strong architecture

``` text
BLE Sensor Node
       ↓
Bluetooth
       ↓
iQOO 15
       ↓
Sensor Fusion
       ↓
On-device AI
```

This allows the iQOO to act as the central intelligence hub.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 24. Wi-Fi 7

   ↓
Result immediately
   ↓
Cloud = optional enhancement
```

This makes the solution more robust in low-connectivity environments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 26. 23-Antenna System

iQOO Community documentation reports a 23-antenna 360° omnidirectional
system.

### Hackathon relevance

The antenna system matters indirectly:

-   Connectivity robustness
-   5G communication
-   Wi-Fi
-   Bluetooth
-   Field operation

This is not normally something your application can directly program as
a sensor.

Treat it as an **infrastructure capability**, not a primary project
feature.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 29. Thermal System

iQOO highlights an **8K-class vapor-chamber cooling system** on the iQOO
15 product page.

### Why this matters for AI

Continuous:

-   camera inference
-   video processing
-   local AI
-   3D rendering
-   sensor fusion

can create sustained computational load.

Thermal design affects:

-   sustained performance
-   throttling behavior
-   responsiveness
-   battery efficiency

### Hackathon opportunity

A project that continuously processes sensor/video streams is a better
demonstration of the phone's performance hardware than a one-shot AI
query.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 34. The Most Interesting Hackathon Sensor

If the goal is **maximum information rather than maximum novelty**, the
camera system is the richest general-purpose input.

But if the goal is **technical differentiation**, the most interesting
combination is:

> **Camera + microphone + accelerometer + gyroscope + local AI**

Why?

Because these channels observe different properties of the same physical
event.

Example:

``` text
Machine
 ├── Camera → visible condition
 ├── Microphone → acoustic signature
 ├── Accelerometer → vibration
 └── Gyroscope → rotational behavior
                    ↓
               iQOO 15
                    ↓
             Multimodal AI
                    ↓
              Diagnosis
```

This is much more difficult to reproduce with a basic phone application.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 40. What NOT to Assume

Before building, verify these items on the actual hackathon device:

### Do not assume:

1.  Raw color-spectrum sensor data is available through public Android
    APIs.
2.  Raw ambient-light data from every physical ambient-light sensor is
    exposed.
3.  Developers can directly program the Hexagon NPU without an
    appropriate runtime.
4.  The Q3 chip is directly programmable by third-party Android
    applications.
5.  Every camera mode/ISP feature is exposed through Camera2/CameraX.
6.  Every external USB/Bluetooth device is permitted by hackathon rules.
7.  Root access is available.
8.  Bootloader unlocking is allowed.
9.  Arbitrary background services can run indefinitely without OS
    restrictions.
10. Every local LLM framework will automatically use the NPU.

These are engineering validation items.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 41. Hardware Validation Checklist for Day 1

# 42. Suggested Benchmark for Your Prototype

Instead of merely showing:

> "Our model runs."

Measure:

``` text

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 44. Final Strategic Takeaway

The iQOO 15 should be thought of as:

> **A battery-powered, camera-equipped, motion-aware, location-aware,
> connected edge-AI computer with dedicated CPU/GPU/NPU compute and
> multiple physical-world I/O channels.**

The highest-value project architecture is therefore not:

``` text
Android App
+
Chatbot
```

It is:

``` text
                 REAL WORLD
                     ↓
        ┌────────────┼────────────┐

             SENSOR FUSION
                     ↓
              LOCAL AI/NPU
                     ↓
                REASONING
                     ↓
              DECISION/ACTION
                     ↓
       IR / NFC / BLE / USB / UI
```

That architecture gives your team a much larger design space for the
Grand Finale.

       |            |            |
      UI          IR/NFC      BLE/USB
       |            |            |
