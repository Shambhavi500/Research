## Section A: Core Vision & Loss-Prevention Features

### 1. Delivery Goods Counting (Multi-Object Computer Vision)
* **What it is:** Instantly identifies and counts dozens of FMCG packets spread across the shop counter in a single photograph.
* **How it works:** The **50MP Ultrawide Camera (119° FOV)** captures the entire 1.5-meter counter in one frame without parallax distortion. An on-device **YOLO11n (INT8)** model running on the Snapdragon 8 Elite Hexagon NPU detects and tallies all supported items (Maggi, Parle-G, soaps, detergents) in **~22 ms**.
* **Why it matters:** Eliminates manual counting during busy morning deliveries; handles 20–30 packets in less than half a second.

### 2. Wholesale Bill Parsing (On-Device OCR)
* **What it is:** Reads handwritten, thermal, or dot-matrix wholesale delivery challans and invoices.
* **How it works:** Uses **PaddleOCR-Mobile v4 / Google ML Kit** running locally in Airplane Mode to detect text bounding boxes, parse product names, and extract billed quantities and wholesale rates using regex coordinate matching.
* **Why it matters:** The shopkeeper doesn't need to type in vendor bills or line items—just photograph the paper slip.

### 3. Automated Discrepancy & Reconciliation Engine
* **What it is:** Compares the physical goods counted against the billed quantities on the invoice.
* **How it works:** A **Jaro-Winkler fuzzy matching algorithm (>0.82 similarity)** links abbreviated invoice text (e.g., *"MAGGI 2M 70G"*) to master catalog SKUs, calculates the shortage delta ($\Delta = \text{Count}_{\text{physical}} - \text{Count}_{\text{billed}}$), and computes the exact rupee loss ($\text{Loss} = |\Delta| \times \text{Rate}$).
* **Why it matters:** Catches short deliveries on the spot (e.g., *"Bill says 24, Counted 20 → ₹56 owed"*), saving **₹8,000–₹15,000/month**.

### 4. Dot-Matrix Expiry Date Scanner (Telemacro OCR)
* **What it is:** Reads faint, tiny inkjet dot-matrix expiration dates printed on crimped plastic packaging.
* **How it works:** Uses the **50MP 3x Periscope Camera** with optical stabilization and telemacro focus from 15–30 cm away. It crops the expiration stamp without casting phone shadows, parses dates (`EXP`, `MFG`, `BEST BEFORE X MONTHS`), and logs batch timestamps into the SQLite database.
* **Why it matters:** Catches expiry dates during stock intake so near-expiry goods can be returned within the distributor’s 30-day return window, saving **₹5,000–₹10,000/month** in dead stock.

### 5. Checkout Expiry Interceptor & Haptic Gate
* **What it is:** Blocks the sale of expired items at the counter before the customer leaves the store.
* **How it works:** When a product batch is added to the cart, the system checks its expiry date against the current date. If expired, it triggers an **aggressive 500ms haptic rumble** on the X-axis linear motor and flashes a full-screen **RED: SALE BLOCKED** warning.
* **Why it matters:** Protects the store's reputation and customer trust by making it physically impossible to accidentally sell spoiled goods.

## Section B: Specialized iQOO 15 Hardware Features

### 6. Color Spectrum & 50Hz Anti-Banding Calibrator
* **What it is:** Prevents glare and dark scan lines on shiny metallized foil packets (Maggi, Kurkure, Lays).
* **How it works:** Queries the **multi-channel Color Spectrum Sensor and Triple Ambient Light Sensors (ALS)** before capturing photos. It detects 50Hz fluorescent tube-light flicker and Correlated Color Temperature (Kelvin), dynamically enforcing `CONTROL_AE_ANTIBANDING_MODE_50HZ` and auto-tuning exposure.
* **Why it matters:** Guarantees crisp, readable images under poor, flickering Indian kirana lighting.

### 7. Cold-Chain Guardian (Integrated IR Blaster Actuator)
* **What it is:** Turns the phone into an autonomous remote control for shop cooling appliances.
* **How it works:** When perishable dairy or ice-cream stock is registered, the phone's top-frame **IR Blaster (`ConsumerIrManager`)** transmits NEC/RC5 infrared pulse trains directly to the store's deep-freezer or counter AC to lock it into super-freeze mode.
* **Why it matters:** Prevents melted ice-cream and curdled milk losses without needing expensive smart plugs or Wi-Fi setups.

### 8. NavIC L5 Cryptographic Proof-of-Delivery (PoD)
* **What it is:** Creates tamper-proof geographic verification for every vendor delivery.
* **How it works:** Uses India's native **NavIC L5 dual-band GNSS** engine to capture sub-meter coordinates and atomic timestamps, embedding them into a cryptographic SHA-256 hash stored in the delivery record.
* **Why it matters:** Overcomes GPS drift inside dense bazaar gullies and tin-roof shops. Vendors cannot claim *"I delivered to your other shop."*

### 9. 1-Tap Distributor Check-in (Omnidirectional NFC)
* **What it is:** Instant vendor identification without touching menus.
* **How it works:** Delivery drivers tap their wholesale RFID badge or crate tag against the iQOO 15’s NFC coil. The app instantly loads the distributor's profile, credit history, and launches the audit camera.
* **Why it matters:** Saves time during the chaotic morning rush hour.

### 10. 144Hz Real-Time AR Neural HUD (Supercomputing Chip Q3)
* **What it is:** Ultra-smooth live bounding box overlay over counter items.
* **How it works:** While the Snapdragon 8 Elite NPU processes neural inference, the **vivo Q3 display co-processor** renders the AR tracking overlays at **144Hz** on a separate hardware surface.
* **Why it matters:** Zero touch lag, zero UI stuttering, and responsive touch controls even during heavy AI workloads.

### 11. Biometric Ledger Vault (3D Ultrasonic Fingerprint)
* **What it is:** Biometric security lock for sensitive wholesale margins and supplier debt sheets.
* **How it works:** Integrated via Android `BiometricPrompt` utilizing Qualcomm's 3D Ultrasonic sensor, which uses acoustic soundwaves rather than optical light.
* **Why it matters:** Unlocks instantly even when the shopkeeper’s fingers are covered in flour, oil, or dust from handling goods.

---

## Section C: Audio & Conversational Features

### 12. Conversational Hindi Voice Assistant
* **What it is:** Ask inventory and financial questions naturally in spoken Hindi or Hinglish.
* **How it works:**
  1. **Whisper-Small INT8** transcribes the voice input offline.
  2. **Laya Multilingual (322M)** extracts intent and entities (e.g., *"Rajesh vendor ne kitna kam diya?"* $\rightarrow$ Intent: `QUERY_SHORTAGE`, Entity: `Rajesh`).
  3. A deterministic SQL query fetches exact facts from SQLite.
  4. An on-device SLM (**BlueLM-1.5B / Llama-3.2-1B**) formats the answer in natural Hindi.
* **Why it matters:** Zero typing and 100% hands-free; the shopkeeper can check records while actively serving customers.

### 13. Built-in "Kirana Soundbox" (High-SPL Stereo Broadcast)
* **What it is:** Loud verbal announcement of delivery verifications and shortage totals.
* **How it works:** Leverages the iQOO 15’s **dual symmetrical high-SPL stereo speakers** with smart PA amplification to broadcast spoken Hindi alerts clearly over 75–80dB shop noise.
* **Why it matters:** Replaces the need to rent a separate Paytm/PhonePe soundbox (saving **₹125/month** in rental fees).

---

## Section D: Cross-Device & Ecosystem Features

### 14. Dual-Screen Trust Mirror & 1-Click Excel Sync (iQOO Office Kit)
* **What it is:** Connects the phone wirelessly to a laptop or counter monitor.
* **How it works:**
  * **Dual Display (Android `Presentation` API):** The shopkeeper's phone shows private purchase rates and shortage alerts; the mirrored laptop screen facing the customer displays a clean, verified itemized receipt.
  * **1-Click Excel Export:** Day-end delivery logs and shortage claims sync instantly via Office Kit clipboard sharing into an `.xlsx` sheet.
* **Why it matters:** Builds customer trust, keeps cost margins private, and saves an hour of manual bookkeeping every evening.
